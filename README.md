## Craft - cost sharing app

1.     A single person tends to pay a bill (at a restaurant, etc) when they go out in a group and 
       they expect to settle the sharing later.
       
2.     When a group of people plan for a trip or similar multiple people spend on multiple items the cost of 
       which needs to be shared later. In such scenarios tracking of settlements becomes a challenge. 
  
### Major usecases
  
  a)    What the user owes to others or vice versa
  
  b)    Should be able to drill down and understand why the settlement amount is X.
  
  c)    Should be able to view expenses for an event
